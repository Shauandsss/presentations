## 💡 About

All presentations are authored and delivered by **Shauan Santos**, a professional passionate about connecting **data, AI, and decision-making** to create meaningful impact in organizations.

Some presentations might contain moments that feel a bit “disconnected” or have slides with less content — that’s part of an ongoing evolution in my presentation style. I’m learning to **describe more directly through the slides themselves**, making each one a stronger storytelling element rather than just a visual cue for live explanations.
